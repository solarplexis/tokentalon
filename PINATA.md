1. Get API key and Gateway URL

Inside the Pinata App select “API Keys” from the sidebar, then click “New Key” in the top right. We would recommend starting with Admin privileges and unlimited uses to start. You will receive a pinata_api_key, pinata_api_secret, and a JWT. The JWT is the most common authentication method and what we’ll be using below.
Next you will want to grab your Gateway domain by clicking the Gateways tab in the sidebar. You should see it listed in the format fun-llama-300.mypinata.cloud and you will want to copy it exactly like that.
​
2. Install and Setup SDK
In the root of your project run the install command with your package manager of choice.

npm

pnpm

yarn

bun

Copy
npm i pinata
Import and initialize the SDK in your codebase with the API key and Gateway from the previous step

Copy
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: "PINATA_JWT",
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});
The PINATA_JWT is a secret key, be sure to initialize the SDK in a secure environment and practice basic variable security practices. If you need to upload from a client environment, consider using signed JWTs
​
3. Upload a File
Use the upload method to upload a File object.

SDK

API

Copy
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const file = new File(["hello world!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
    const upload = await pinata.upload.public.file(file);
    console.log(upload);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await main();
You should get a response object like the one below

SDK

API

Copy
{
  id: "0195f815-5c5e-716d-9240-d3ae380e2002",
  group_id: null,
  name: "hello.txt",
  cid: "bafkreidvbhs33ighmljlvr7zbv2ywwzcmp5adtf4kqvlly67cy56bdtmve",
  created_at: "2025-04-02T19:58:24.616Z",
  size: 12,
  number_of_files: 1,
  mime_type: "text/plain",
  vectorized: false,
  network: "public",
}
​
4. Retrieve a File through a Gateway
Use the cid of a file to fetch it through a Gateway directly or create a URL

SDK

API

Copy
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await pinata.gateways.public.get("bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq");
    console.log(data)

    const url = await pinata.gateways.convert(
      "bafkreib4pqtikzdjlj4zigobmd63lig7u6oxlug24snlr6atjlmlza45dq"
    )
    console.log(url)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

main();
